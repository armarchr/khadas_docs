title: Quick Start
---

This article mainly introduces how to quickly get started after getting the development board to make the system run.

## Quick connect and boot

1. Type-C: Type-C port is the power connection port

2. HDMI: Standard HDMI socket, connect your display

3. ETH (optional): Ethernet port holder

After the power is turned on, it starts normally, and you can see the Khadas Logo on the display, and the white light flashes

## Troubleshooting

1. The blue light is always on and the boot screen is not seen: the WoL function is turned on, press the Power button to boot normally, turn off WOL->[How to use WOL](/linux/vim3/Wol)
2. Repeated restarts: insufficient power supply, please use the official recommended external power supply

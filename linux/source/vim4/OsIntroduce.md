Khadas officially supports and updates the **Ubuntu** distribution; **OTA upgrades are also available**.

## Supported Ubuntu Distributions

`VIM4` supports `Ubuntu 20.04` using kernel **5.4**. We support both **desktop** and **server** versions. The desktop environment uses the **GNOME** desktop.

Supported installations:

* `SD/USB` - Write the OS into an SD card or USB thumbdrive

{% note info %}
The mainline kernel can only be installed into an SD card, however you can copy the OS into the eMMC after the OS has booted up.
{% endnote %}

{% note info %}
If the image name includes the text **EMMC**, it is meant for eMMC installation. If it includes **SD-USB**, it is meant for SD card installation.
{% endnote %}
